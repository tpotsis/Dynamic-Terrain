Computational modeling of the lower atmospheric boundary layer by LES

Step 1: Generation of inlet data.

Step 2: Modification of inlet data with the LMM approach (empty domain).

Step 3: Verification of mean, standard deviation and lenght scales of velocity at location of the building (empty domain).

Step 4: Inlet data based on Step 3, with th ebuilding located in the computational domain.

Step 5: Extract pressure time series in selected taps, with selcetd frequency.
